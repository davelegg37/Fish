		<div>Colorless Fish</div>
		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>Listen</div>
		<div>After Mother Nature created the oceans she created fish to swim in the oceans. She made some fish red, others yellow and still others blue. Then she grew tired and went to sleep. </div>
		<div>Chance, however, never sleeps and continued to influence the oceans and the fish.      The red fish mixed with the blue fish, the yellow fish mixed with both and all the resulting fish mixed with each other until the oceans were filled with a rainbow of difference.</div>
		<div>There were big orange fish with black stripes, little pink fish with long wavy tails and triangle shaped fish colored pastel blue; the sea was a constantly changing swirl of shapes and colors.</div>
		<div>As Chance changed the fish, the oceans changed to accommodate all the new varieties. Coral reefs grew to provide homes for the small fish. Some oceans grew large to provide room for the big fish. </div>
		<div>Some fish liked the waving sea weed while others preferred the wildness of the ocean currents. Chance created new oceans to fit new fish and the new oceans gave rise to an even greater diversity of fish and plants.</div>
		<div>When Mother Nature awoke she was amazed at what she saw. The single ocean filled with red, yellow and blue fish that she had created was gone.  In its place were many different seas and oceans filled with difference; different colors and different shapes all moving and mixing together forming a beautiful, constantly shifting collage.</div>
		<div>"It was Chance," she thought. "Chance always surprises me," and she smiled and went back to sleep. Chance of course does not sleep and as Mother Nature slept it continued to influence her creation</div>
		<div>Now some of the fish were disappointed in themselves.  They wanted to be bluer or pinker, bigger or smaller but they could not change themselves, only Chance could do that and no one could control Chance. They soon discovered, that by schooling together and separating themselves from the other fish they felt bluer or pinker, bigger or smaller. Better yet the more they separated from the others the easier it was to blame all their problems on the other fish. "It's the orange fish's fault," said the green fish. "Before they developed, the ocean was a great place to live."  "There are too many small fish around here," complained the big fish. "They take up all the room. Before long there won't be anymore ocean left for us."        As the fish continued to separate from one another into their own groups, their bickering and complaining about one another grew. Fights broke out between the different schools of fish and the fights escalated to wars.</div>
		<div>Mother Nature was awakened by the racket. "What happened to my beautiful oceans filled with all that wonderful diversity?" she thought. "You just can't trust Chance," she muttered and prepared to leave the world to its own. </div>
		<div>"Wait!" said some of the fish. "You got us into this mess. It was you who made us different colors. You have to correct your mistake. Take away our color and make us all alike."</div>
		<div>"What the fish says is true," thought Mother Nature and so against her better judgment she removed all the color and difference from the fish until the oceans were filled with colorless fish of the exact same size. Exhausted by her effort she went back to sleep.</div>
		<div>When Mother Nature awoke again all the different oceans had merged into one and only a few fish remained.
"What happened?" she asked one of the remaining fish.
"It was Chance," replied the fish. "Chance needs something to change and when all the fish were the same there was nothing for Chance to work with so he got bored and left. Since all the fish were the same there was no need for all the different oceans and soon they disappeared. Even we fish, who were now all the same, lost interest in each other and our numbers declined. Please Mother Nature give us back our different colors."</div>
		<div>Mother Nature was growing impatient.        "OK," she said to the fish. "I'll restore you to your original three colors but then I'm leaving your world and no matter what Chance does to you, you will just have to live with it."</div>
		<div>Many years later Mother Nature happened to be passing the world and she looked in to see how her ocean and fish were doing. Chance had again been at work and the world once again was filled with difference:  different oceans and seas, fish of different colors and shapes, sea weeds and corals.  The beauty of variety had returned, but this time without the destructiveness of separation.      "What happened?" Mother Nature asked the fish. "How were you able to avoid the destructive side effects of diversity."       "We changed our point of view," replied the fish. "Instead of magnifying the importance of our own difference for ourselves, we recognized the importance of each others difference for all of us."                                 THE   END</div>
